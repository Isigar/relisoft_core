# rcore.cz

The simple way to code with ESX. rcore is a framework that's the whole point is to simplify life to your developers and coders, you can imagine if you are creating your scripts, you always do the same thinks, create markers, check distances, check keypress and lot of more that you have to do at every single script, or using datastore, esx\_addoninventory, addonaccount and always you have to look at some other script, how I can get datastore or account instance and functions... I really don't like creating code twice so I create rcore, its take of your solders all thinks that you have done at every script, now you can do the complex task with simple code, like register society, number or datastore with a single line of code.
